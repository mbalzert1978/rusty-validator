# Email Validator

This project provides a simple email validation library written in Rust, with Python bindings using PyO3. The library uses the `validator` crate to validate email addresses.

## Features

- Validate email addresses using Rust.
- Expose the validation functionality to Python using PyO3.

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `maturin` for building and publishing the Python package

## Installation

### Rust

To use the Rust library directly, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
email_validator = "0.1.0"
```

### Python

To use the Python bindings, you need to build the package first. You can do this using `maturin`.

1. Install `maturin`:

```sh
pip install maturin
```

2. Build and install the package:

```sh
maturin develop
```

This will compile the Rust code and install the Python package in your current environment.

## Usage

### Rust

Here's an example of how to use the email validation function in Rust:

```rust
use email_validator::validate;

fn main() {
    let email = "example@example.com".to_string();
    match validate(email) {
        Ok(is_valid) => println!("Is valid: {}", is_valid),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### Python

Here's an example of how to use the email validation function in Python:

```python
from email_validator import validate

email = "example@example.com"
is_valid = validate(email)
print(f"Is valid: {is_valid}")
```

## Development
